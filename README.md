## 📌 Goal
To explore how cancer stage, smoking, and comorbidities affect survival outcomes in lung cancer patients.  

---

## 📊 Key Findings
- **Stage I vs Stage IV:** Almost identical survival rates.  
- **Smokers vs Non-smokers:** No clear difference in survival.  
- **Comorbidities:** Appeared irrelevant.  

---

## ⚠️ Critical Lesson
After hours of analysis, I discovered the dataset was **synthetic** and created for educational purposes.  
This explained the unrealistic results.  

**Takeaway:** Always investigate dataset origin and context before deep analysis.

## 🔧 Tools
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- Jupyter Notebook
